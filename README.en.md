# Learning Project in C and SDL2

This repository is part of my journey learning **C** and the **SDL2** library.  
The main purpose is to keep track of my progress, including mistakes and corrections, so that other beginners can see how a project evolves step by step.

## Development Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows  
- **Compilation:** MSYS2, MinGW, SDL2  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code  

## Final Goal
To build an **educational simulator** for prototyping basic electronic circuits.  
This project is not meant to be a polished product, but rather a learning exercise following good practices and documenting the process.
